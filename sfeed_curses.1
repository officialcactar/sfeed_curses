.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm sfeed_curses
.Nd curses UI for viewing feed items
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar file...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
shows feed data (TSV) in the format
.Xr sfeed 5
which is read from stdin or
.Ar file
into a UI.
If one or more
.Ar file
are specified, the basename of the
.Ar file
is used as the feed name in the output such as the feeds sidebar.
If no
.Ar file
parameters are specified and so the data is read from stdin then the feed name
is "stdin".
.Pp
When the data is read from files then there will be a sidebar with the feeds.
When the data is read from stdin then here will be no sidebar visible by
default.
.Pp
Items with a timestamp from the last day compared to the system time at the
time of loading the feed are automatically marked as new and bold.
There is also an alternative mode available to mark items as read by matching
against a list of urls from a plain-text file.
.Pp
.Nm
aligns the output.
Make sure the environment variable
.Ev LC_CTYPE
is set to a UTF-8 locale, so it can determine the proper column-width
per rune, using
.Xr mbtowc 3
and
.Xr wcwidth 3 .

.It Ev SFEED_PIPER
A program where the whole TAB-Separated Value line is piped to.
By default this is "sfeed_content".
.It Ev SFEED_PIPER_INTERACTIVE
Handle the program interactively in the same terminal or not.
If set to "1" then before execution it restores the terminal attributes and
.Nm
will wait until the program is finished.
If set to "0" then it will suppress stdout and stderr output.
By default this is set to "1".
.It Ev SFEED_PLUMBER
A program that received the link url or enclosure url as a parameter.
By default this is "xdg-open".
.It Ev SFEED_PLUMBER_INTERACTIVE
Handle the program interactively in the same terminal or not.
If set to "1" then before execution it restores the terminal attributes and
.Nm
will wait until the program is finished.
If set to "0" then it will suppress stdout and stderr output.
By default this is set to "0".
This option is useful to open a text-mode browser in the same terminal.
.It Ev SFEED_YANKER
A program where the url or enclosure field is piped to, to copy it to a
clipboard.
By default this is "xclip -r".
.It Ev SFEED_YANKER_INTERACTIVE
